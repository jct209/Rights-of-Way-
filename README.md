# Rights-of-Way-
<h2> What the project does </h2> 
Project dedicated to mapping Rights of Way in the UK using data from www.ROWMAPS.com.  Project consists of Kaggle notebooks using python to:   
1)Simple code to review GEOJSON data of PROW In a specific county  
2) Code to perform descriptive statistics on the DISTANCE variable of a PRoW (Coming Soon)  
3) <h2> Why the project is useful? </h2>  
Public Rights of Way are under threat. in 2026, any unregistered PRoW will be removed from public usage, or extinguished. The Ramblers have collected data on the lost rights of way. This project creates preparatory code which can be used to help future Machine Learning project predict where missing Public Rights of Way are and what characteristics they share.

<h2> How users can get started with the project? </h2>  
Help me produce code that maps and analyses data about the distribution, distance and other variables about PRoW
